## About Bower

I have used [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage Bootstrap and jQuery because due to missing Glyphicon font files, I couldn't see the icons on the page. So, I decided to use my own complete Bootstrap library. If you are unfamiliar with Bower, you need not worry about it. Just delete the **bower_components** folder and change urls of linked scripts and stylesheets on the webpages. Using local library files is ok for development purposes. But in the production environment, it is generally advised to use CDN links for improving page load times.
